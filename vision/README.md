OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is released under a BSD license and hence itâ€™s free for both academic and commercial use. 
It has C++, Python and Java interfaces and supports Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS and Android. 
OpenCV was designed for computational efficiency and with a strong focus on real-time applications. Written in optimized C/C++, the library can take advantage of multi-core processing. 
Enabled with OpenCL, it can take advantage of the hardware acceleration of the underlying heterogeneous compute platform.

Adopted all around the world, OpenCV has more than 47 thousand people of user community and estimated number of downloads exceeding 14 million. 
Usage ranges from interactive art, to mines inspection, stitching maps on the web or through advanced robotics.
